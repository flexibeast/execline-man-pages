script
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bd -literal
#!/command/execlineb -P

# This execlineb script will sleep for 1 second, then print some
# silly things on the standard output.


foreground     # an unquoted string, evaluated to: foreground
{              # A single opening brace, not included in the argv
  sleep 1      # Two unquoted strings, evaluated to " sleep" and " 1"
               # (without the quotation marks).
}              # A single closing brace, evaluated to the empty word

"echo"     # this is a quoted string. It will evaluate to the word: echo

foo\e bar\e zoinx  # This is one word, since the spaces are escaped
"foo bar zoinx"  # This is exactly the same word, written another way

 " # this is not a comment, since it is inside a quoted string
# This is not a comment either \e" # nor is this " # but this is one

"\e0x41\e66\e0103D\en"   # This is the string ABCD followed by a newline.
                     # Be careful: the newline will be part of the word.

 \en   # this is not a newline, but the single word: n

$23   # This will NOT be replaced by anything with execline-1.y, unless
      # substitution is explicitly asked for in the script.
      # The dollar is no special character for the execline binary.

baz"\&$1"qux  # This will evaluate to the word baz$1qux
baz\e$1qux   # Same here
baz$1qux    # Same here in execline-1.y

${PATH}   # This will NOT be replaced by execline ; use the importas command
          # if you need the $PATH value.

\&'this is not a string\&'  # it will be parsed as five separate words

"\e
"        # This will be parsed as the empty word. A (backslash, newline)
         # sequence inside a quoted string is entirely removed.
