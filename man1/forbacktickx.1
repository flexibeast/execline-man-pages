.Dt FORBACKTICKX 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm forbacktickx
.Nd run a program and use its output as loop elements to run another program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
In an
.Xr execlineb 1
script:
.Pp
.Nm
.Op Fl E | Fl e
.Op Fl p | Fl o Ar okcodes | Fl x Ar breakcodes
.Op Fl N | Fl n
.Op Fl C | Fl c
.Op Fl 0 | Fl d Ar delim
.Ar variable
{
.Ar gen...
}
.Ar loop...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads a block
.Po
cf.\&
.Xr execline-block 7
.Pc ,
.Ar gen... ,
and unquotes it.
.Pp
It runs
.Ar gen...
as a child process.
.Ar gen Ap
s output must not contain a null character.
.Pp
It reads
.Ar gen Ap
s output as it needs, splitting
.Po
cf.\&
.Xr execline-transform 7
.Pc
it automatically.
.Pp
For every argument
.Ar x
in the split output,
.Nm
runs
.Ar loop...
as a child process, with
.Sm off
.Ar variable
=
.Ar x
.Sm on
added to its environment.
.Pp
.Nm
then exits 0.
.Pp
You can start
.Ar loop...
with
.Ql importas -u Ar variable Ar variable
to perform variable substitution.
.Nm
is now implemented as a wrapper around the
.Xr pipeline 1
and
.Xr forstdin 1
commands, with calls to
.Xr fdmove 1
to ensure that
.Ar loop...
is called with the proper standard input.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Fl p
Parallel mode.
Do not wait for a
.Ar loop...
instance to finish before spawning the next one.
.Nm
will still wait for all instances of
.Ar loop
to terminate before exiting, though.
.It Fl o Ar okcodes
.Ar okcodes
must be a comma-separated list of exit codes.
If the
.Fl p
flag hasn't been given and
.Ar loop
exits with one of the codes in
.Ar okcodes ,
.Nm
will run the following instances of the loop, but if the exit code is
not listed in
.Ar okcodes ,
.Nm
will exit immediately with an approximation
.Po
cf.\&
.Xr execline-exitcodes 7
.Pc
of the same exit code.
.It Fl x Ar breakcodes
Like the previous option, but with inverted meaning - the listed exit
codes are codes that will make
.Nm
break the loop and exit, and the unlisted exit codes will make it keep
looping.
.It Fl e
No autoimport.
This is the default.
.It Fl E
Autoimport.
Instead of spawning
.Ar loop... ,
spawn
.Ql importas -ui Ar variable Ar variable Ar loop... .
This substitutes
.Ar variable
into the command line instead of putting it into the environment.
.El
.Pp
Other options are similar (in name and functionality) to the switches
passed to control a substitution mechanism[1]
.Po
cf.\&
.Xr execline-transform 7
.Pc ,
on purpose; however,
.Nm
does not call the substitution mechanism and has its own semantics for
those options.
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Fl N
Store the whole line in
.Ar variable ,
including the terminating newline (or other delimiter).
.It Fl n
Chomp a terminating delimiter from the line from stdin before storing
it into
.Ar variable .
This is the default.
.It Fl C
Crunch.
If there is an empty line (i.e. that only contains a delimiter), do
not call
.Ar loop .
If this option is given,
.Em and
chomping is active,
.Em and
the last line of stdin is not terminated by a delimiter, then this
last line will not be processed.
.It Fl c
Do not crunch, call
.Ar loop
even if the line is empty.
This is the default.
.It Fl 0
Accept null characters on its stdin, using them as delimiters.
If this option and a
.Fl d
option are used simultaneously, the rightmost one wins.
.It Fl d Ar delim
Use the characters in string
.Ar delim
as delimiters for a line.
Default is
.Ql \en ,
meaning the input is only split on newlines.
